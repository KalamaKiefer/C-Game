This game is made using C++ and SFML. It allows user to be a dragon and fly through the sky using the space bar to move up and down.
There are objects or rocks floating in the sky that if hit will end the game.
The purpose of the game is to avoid the rocks and collect stars and see how far you can go and how high of a score you can achieve.
